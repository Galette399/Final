	<h1>Astral Ever Glow</h1>
    <p>Bobby lives on Earth in New York, but him and his family are not from Earth. They are from a planet called Astral Ever Glow. It's a special place because it was a beautiful place. It was a fantasy mystical world with magic, forest, villages, and it was kind of like a utopia nothing bad really happened here. It was kind of like the world from the show Adventure Time (The Land of Ooo). It was made up with a bunch of kingdoms and a bunch of people, but everyone was friendly with each other, and they all worked together to keep this beautiful, enchanted place alive. Astral Ever Glow is kind of like Earth, but also different. This planet is the most like Earth in the in the way that if a human came to this planet they could live like normal. What makes this planet different is it's like Earth but a lot more like a fantasy. Every single person that lived on this planet has special abilities and powers. The reason Bobby and his family now live on Earth is because there was a very dangerous and evil guy and he lived on another planet. He wanted to take over the universe and be the leader of every planet. Astral Ever Glow and other planets didn't like what he was doing so they wanted to go to war to stop him, but it was too late. He created something like the Death Star from Star Wars, and he was able to totally blow up and destroy Astral Ever Glow. Bobby and his family were able to safely escape on an escape pod. They had to go to Earth because Earth was the only planet closest to Astral Ever Glow that could sustain them.</p>
