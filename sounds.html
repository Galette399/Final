	<h1>The Sounds of Bobby And His Home</h1>
    <p>Bobby lives in a suburban area. He lives in a medium sized house and it's not super big but it's not small. He lives with his mom, dad, and brother. He lives in the suburbs but he's from the city. Bobby makes music and has a few albums out. The weather where he lives is normal and it has the changing seasons. Since he is not in the city, he can hear sounds like crickets, birds, and others nature sounds.
